<h3 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h3>

<p>Database was created using mySQL.</p>

<p>MySQL database scheme:

<br /></p>

<p>First chain of this process is an orders list, containing information about project, Client, date of the order, number of order and volume of needed concrete in cubic meters.</p>

<br /></p>

<p>Depending on the recipe for concrete, different ratio between the ingredients has to be applied to recive the conrete with expected properties. Recipes with different ingredients ratio needed to produce 1 cubic meter of concrete are shown in the table.</p>

<br /></p>

<p>Calculating the usage of ingredients are key for controlling purposes of tankage. Cement silo and other tanks for ingredients have to be regulary refilled.</p>

<p>As stated before ingredients for concrete production are crucial and have to be routinely refilled. Purpose of graph presented below is the control function for cement silo. The graph is showing the process of cement consumption and refill.</p>
